<h1 class="heading">Welcome to Manonmani's Blog</h1>
<p class="para1">Hello guys let's see an interesting story about my life. I got placed in a company named GSS but i didn't receive the call letter. So, I was very much upset. Then one day,when i was surfing the net,i came to know about EDWISOR. It is a platform which trains and employees you. But the cost for joining the course was high for me due to my family situation. I created an account in that website and did free trail in front-end development course. After 2 days i received a call from a man named Aditya Kumar, who works @ edwisor. He was asking me whether i was interested to join the course and he enquired about what i am doing currently. It was an half an hour discussion.Then i thought of asking my nephew about this course but unfortunately he didn't send any reply and i got fed-up. So i thought of thinking about that course.</p>
<p class="para2">Suddenly one day i thought that why should we take this course and become a front-end developer. So i started asking my friends, nephew and niece about this. Many told, no one knows about this course and as same as before my nephew didn't reply. But my niece adviced me to attend off-campus and not not to take the course. I was ok at that time. Since i am a double-minded person. I thought of taking the course and i should prove myself and others that by taking independent decision, i am able to achieve success. I woke-up @ morning and thought of calling them but i was very guilty because i didn't respond to them when they spoke before. But by god's grace they spoke to me that whether i like to join the course. So i told yes and made the payment.</p>
<p class="para3">I started doing the course. It is superb and makes me to do assignments weekly. I am getting good score and i hope that i will be able to finish the course and do projects and get placed in core company. I am hoping for the best and i will achieve my goal to be a front-end developer till end of my life.</p>
